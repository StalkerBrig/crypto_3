Steps for lab 3:

1) rsa-sign and rsa-validate

- rsa-sign takes a private key, a message, and an output file. It hashes the messages and then encrypts it with the private key.
  The public key that corresponds to this private key will be used in validation.
- rsa-validate takes a public key, a message, and a signature file. The signature file is the same that was created in rsa-sign.
  It uses the public key to decrypt the signature file and compares that output to the hash of the message mod N. If they are
  equal, then spit out True, otherwise False. The public key must correspond to the private key that signed the message originally.

Lock
	Generate the AES key, encrypt it with the public key (unlock_pub) from -p flag 
	and sign it with the private key from r flag (lock_priv).  Everything is encrypted with 
	the AES key


	to lock: ./lock -d test1 -p unlock_pub -r lock_priv -v CA_public_key


Unlock:
	The person who can unlock it, comes in and checks to make sure the manifest sign corresponds
	to the -p public key (lock_pub).  Then they decrypt the manifest file with their 
	private key(unlock_priv).  Then decrypt everything with the AES key.

	to unlock: ./unlock -d test1 -p lock_pub -r unlock_priv -v CA_public_key
